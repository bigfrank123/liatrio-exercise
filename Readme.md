# DevOps engagement with XYZ
XYZ has requested help with their ongoing DevOps transformation. They have noted issues with their environement creation and deploment processes. 

## Knowledge gathering
This is needed to assess current state. Working on the assumption that XYZ has attempted a DevOps transition in the past, there is a need to determine what the Organization's understanding of the concepts of DevOps is; IE, the "Why".
- [ ] Senior leadership interviews.
    - Why did they choose to adopt DevOps?
- [ ] Interview Architects
    - What caused them to fail the first time?
- [ ] Interview Team to further narrow down root cause.
    - What time did the team take to learn concepts?

The output of this should be a firm understanding of XYZ's Current state and what caused their original transformation to fail. 

## Engagement Planning and Team Chartering

After a root cause has been identified we need to determine what is the best steps to move forward. Each team is different and will have different needs for tranformation in regards to Technology, Process, and Product understanding. It is my preference to work with the most mature teams first; getting in some quick wins to allow for faster apotion for less mature teams.
