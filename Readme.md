# DevOps engagement with XYZ
XYZ has requested help with their ongoing DevOps transformation. They have noted issues with their environement creation and deploment processes. 

## Knowledge gathering (1-2 weeks)
This is needed to assess current state. Working on the assumption that XYZ has attempted a DevOps transition in the past, there is a need to determine what the Organization's understanding of the concepts of DevOps is; IE, the "Why".
- [ ] Senior leadership interviews.
    - Why did they choose to adopt DevOps?
    - Company Culture pulse check
    - What is DevOps?
        - IF "CI/CD": :triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post:
            - See above "Why?"
- [ ] Interview Architects
    - What caused them to fail the first time?
    - Company Culture pulse check
    - What is DevOps?
        - See above.
        - "Who owns the Infrastructure for any given app?"
        - "How long does it take to restore service after an outage?"
        - "How does your org sunset Legacy Applications?"
            - "We dont" :bangbang::bangbang:
- [ ] Interview Team to further narrow down root cause.
    - What time did the team take to learn concepts?
    - Company Culture pulse check
    - What is DevOps?
        - See above.
     - "What is your deployment frequency?"
         - IF "Every two weeks" "Are your deploymenets tied to sprints?"
     - "What is your branching strategy in Source Coontrol, if any?"
     - "When I say 'Agile', what is the first word that comes to mind?"
The output of this should be a firm understanding of XYZ's Current state and what caused their original transformation to fail. 

## Engagement Planning and Team Chartering (1 Week)

After a root cause has been identified we need to determine what is the best steps to move forward. Each team is different and will have different needs for tranformation in regards to Technology, Process, and Product understanding. It is my preference to work with the most mature teams first; getting in some quick wins to allow for faster apotion for less mature teams. 

### Team Chartering (1 day)

    Team Introductions: Name, Role, Icebreaker.
    
    Skills Self-Assessment:
    
    Team Vision and Mission
    
    Working Agreement - schedule, Andon cord, etc
    
    Roles and Responsibilities

    For Each team:
    - Kickoff
       - Presentation
           - Introductions
           - What is DevOps?
           - What is a Dojo?
           - What's next and Schedule
    - Dojo Engagement
        - 2.5 days sprints
        - learn something in the AM, apply it in the PM
